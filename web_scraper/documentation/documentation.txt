# Alien Information Web Scraper Documentation

## Overview

This bot is designed to scrape the internet for the latest information related to aliens, UFOs, UAPs, and similar content from a variety of online platforms. It uses Python with Beautiful Soup and Selenium for web scraping, Requests or urllib for making HTTP requests, and MongoDB for storing scraped data.

## File Structure

The bot is organized into several Python files, each responsible for a specific part of the scraping process:

- main.py: The main entry point for the bot.
- scraping/: Contains the scrapers for different types of websites.
- data_extraction/: Contains the data extractors for different types of content.
- data_cleaning/: Contains the data cleaner and duplicate handler.
- data_storage/: Contains the MongoDB connector and data storer.
- performance/: Contains the efficiency manager and rate limiter.
- error_handling/: Contains the error handler and logger.
- automation/: Contains the scheduler and manual trigger.
- updates_maintenance/: Contains the update manager.
- testing_deployment/: Contains the testing and deployment scripts.
- config.py: Contains the global configurations for the bot.
- requirements.txt: Lists the Python libraries required to run the bot.

## Running the Bot

To run the bot, execute the main.py file. You can also schedule the bot to run automatically using the scheduler in the automation/ directory, or manually trigger it using the manual trigger.

## Error Handling and Logging

The bot has robust error handling implemented in the error_handling/ directory. All actions, including errors, are logged for debugging and improvement purposes.

## Updates and Maintenance

The bot is designed to be easily updated and maintained. The update manager in the updates_maintenance/ directory provides functions for updating the bot as websites change their structures and scraping policies.

## Testing and Deployment

Before deploying the bot, run the testing script in the testing_deployment/ directory to ensure it is functioning as expected. The deployment script provides support for deploying the bot in a production environment.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues while running the bot, check the logs in the error_handling/logger.py file for any error messages. If the issue persists, you may need to update the bot using the update manager.

## Updating the Bot

To update the bot, use the functions provided in the update_manager.py file. You may need to update the bot if websites change their structures or scraping policies, or if you want to add new features or improve existing ones.
