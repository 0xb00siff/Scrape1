# Alien Information Web Scraper Documentation

## Overview

This bot is designed to scrape the internet for the latest information related to aliens, UFOs, UAPs, and similar content from a variety of online platforms. It uses Python with Beautiful Soup and Selenium for web scraping, Requests or urllib for making HTTP requests, and MongoDB for storing scraped data.

### scraper.py

This file contains the main scraping functions. It is responsible for navigating through the websites, handling pagination, infinite scrolling, and pop-ups, and extracting the raw data.

### data_extractor.py

This file is responsible for extracting specific data from the raw HTML content scraped by scraper.py. It extracts textual data, images, videos, and metadata such as the date of posting, author, source URL, and any associated tags or keywords.

### data_cleaner.py

This file is responsible for cleaning the extracted data. It removes any irrelevant information, advertisements, or other non-essential elements, and handles duplicates to avoid storing redundant data.

### data_storage.py

This file is responsible for storing the cleaned and structured data in MongoDB. The data is stored in a structured format like JSON with fields such as title, content, date, author, tags, source, and type (text, image, video).

### error_handler.py

This file contains functions for handling errors during the scraping process. It is used across all the files that perform operations which could potentially fail.

### logger.py

This file contains functions for logging actions and errors. It is used across all the files to log their activities and any issues that occur.

### scheduler.py

This file contains functions for scheduling and triggering the bot. It can run the bot on a scheduled basis, for instance, daily, weekly, etc., and also provides an option to trigger the bot manually when needed.

### updater.py

This file contains functions for updating the bot as websites change their structures and scraping policies over time.

### tests

This directory contains test functions for each of the main components of the bot. These tests are used in deployment.py to ensure the bot is functioning as expected before deployment.

### deployment.py

This file is responsible for deploying the bot in a production environment. It includes a thorough testing phase before deployment and provides support for future updates and maintenance of the bot.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues while running the bot, check the logs generated by logger.py for any error messages or warnings. If the issue is related to a specific component of the bot, check the corresponding file and its test functions in the tests directory.

## Updates

To update the bot, use the functions provided in updater.py. These functions allow you to update the bot's configurations, add new data sources, and adjust the bot's behavior as websites change their structures and scraping policies.

Remember to run the test functions in the tests directory after making any updates to ensure the bot is still functioning as expected.
