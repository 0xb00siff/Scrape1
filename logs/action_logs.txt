The file "logs/action_logs.txt" is a text file meant for logging actions. It doesn't contain any executable code. However, it can be created and written to by the logger module in the application. Here is a Python snippet that would create and write to this file:

```python
def log_action(message):
    with open("logs/action_logs.txt", "a") as log_file:
        log_file.write(message + "\n")
```

This function can be used throughout the application to log actions. For example, when the web scraper successfully scrapes a page, it could call `log_action("Successfully scraped page: " + page_url)`.
