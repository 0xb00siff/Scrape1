Shared Dependencies:

1. Python Libraries: BeautifulSoup, Selenium, Requests/urllib, and pymongo are shared across multiple files for web scraping, making HTTP requests, and interacting with MongoDB.

2. Configurations: The "config.py" file will contain shared configurations like base URLs, database connection details, and other global settings. These configurations will be imported and used in multiple files.

3. Data Schemas: The data schema for the scraped data (title, content, date, author, tags, source, type) will be shared across the data extraction, data cleaning, and data storage files.

4. Utility Functions: Functions for handling pagination, infinite scrolling, and pop-ups will be defined in their respective utility files and used in the scraper files. Similarly, the robots_txt_handler will provide a function to check the website's scraping policies, which will be used in all scraper files.

5. Error Handling and Logging: The "error_handler.py" and "logger.py" files will provide functions for error handling and logging. These functions will be used across all files to handle exceptions and log actions.

6. MongoDB Connector: The "mongodb_connector.py" file will provide a connection to the MongoDB database. This connection will be used in the "data_storer.py" file to store the scraped data.

7. Efficiency Manager and Rate Limiter: The "efficiency_manager.py" and "rate_limiter.py" files will provide functions to manage the bot's efficiency and rate limit its requests. These functions will be used in the scraper files.

8. Scheduler and Manual Trigger: The "scheduler.py" and "manual_trigger.py" files will provide functions to automate and manually trigger the bot. These functions will be used in the "main.py" file to control the bot's operation.

9. Update Manager: The "update_manager.py" file will provide functions for updating and maintaining the bot. These functions will be used in the "main.py" file and potentially in other files as needed.

10. Testing and Deployment: The "testing.py" and "deployment.py" files will provide functions for testing the bot and deploying it in a production environment. These functions will be used in the "main.py" file and potentially in other files as needed.
