Shared Dependencies:

1. Configurations: All the files will share a common configuration file "config.py" which will contain the settings for the web scraper such as base URLs, pagination settings, sleep intervals, MongoDB connection details, etc.

2. Data Schema: The data schema for the scraped data will be shared across the "data_extractor.py", "data_cleaner.py", and "data_storage.py" files. The schema will define the structure of the data to be stored in MongoDB, including fields like title, content, date, author, tags, source, and type.

3. Error Handling: The "error_handler.py" file will contain functions for handling errors during the scraping process. These functions will be used across all the files that perform operations which could potentially fail, such as "scraper.py", "data_extractor.py", "data_cleaner.py", and "data_storage.py".

4. Logging: The "logger.py" file will contain functions for logging actions and errors. These functions will be used across all the files to log their activities and any issues that occur.

5. Web Scraping and Data Extraction Functions: The functions for web scraping and data extraction defined in "scraper.py" and "data_extractor.py" will be used in "scheduler.py" and "updater.py" to perform the scraping and extraction tasks.

6. Data Cleaning Functions: The functions for data cleaning defined in "data_cleaner.py" will be used in "scheduler.py" and "updater.py" to clean the extracted data before storage.

7. Data Storage Functions: The functions for storing data defined in "data_storage.py" will be used in "scheduler.py" and "updater.py" to store the cleaned and structured data in MongoDB.

8. Test Functions: The test functions defined in the "tests" directory will be used in "deployment.py" to ensure the bot is functioning as expected before deployment.

9. Scheduler Functions: The functions for scheduling and triggering the bot defined in "scheduler.py" will be used in "deployment.py" to automate the scraping process.

10. Updater Functions: The functions for updating the bot defined in "updater.py" will be used in "deployment.py" to maintain the bot over time.
