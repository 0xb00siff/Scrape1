Shared Dependencies:

1. Imported Libraries: All files will import necessary Python libraries such as BeautifulSoup, Selenium, Requests or urllib, and pymongo for MongoDB.

2. Configurations: All files will use the configurations defined in "config/config.py", "config/urls.py", and "config/credentials.py". These configurations include base URLs, API endpoints, database credentials, and other global settings.

3. Error Handling and Logging: All files will use the error handling functions defined in "src/error_handler.py" and logging functions in "src/logger.py". These functions will be used to catch, handle, and log errors during the execution of the bot.

4. Data Schema: The data schema defined for MongoDB storage in "src/data_storage.py" will be used by "src/data_cleaner.py", "src/data_extractor.py", and "src/web_scraper.py" to ensure the data is in the correct format for storage.

5. Utility Functions: All files will use utility functions defined in "src/utils.py". These functions may include helper functions for making HTTP requests, parsing HTML, handling strings, and other common tasks.

6. Test Cases: All test files in the "tests/" directory will use the same set of test cases to ensure consistency across all unit tests.

7. Scheduler: The scheduler defined in "src/scheduler.py" will be used by "src/main.py" to automate the execution of the bot.

8. Updater: The updater defined in "src/updater.py" will be used by "src/main.py" to handle updates and maintenance of the bot.

9. Documentation: All files will refer to the same documentation file "docs/documentation.md" for instructions and guidelines.

10. DOM Elements: The id names of DOM elements that JavaScript functions will use will be shared across "src/web_scraper.py" and "src/data_extractor.py".

11. Message Names: Message names for logging and error handling will be shared across all files.

12. Function Names: Function names will be shared across all files for consistency and ease of use. For example, a function to scrape data might be named "scrape_data()" in all relevant files.
